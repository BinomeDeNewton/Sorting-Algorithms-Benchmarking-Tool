# Sorting Algorithms & Benchmarking Tool

This Python project provides an implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort. It offers a graphical user interface to compare the performance of these algorithms on lists of elements.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** The project implements several common algorithms including bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
- **Performance Comparison:** The graphical interface enables measuring and comparing execution times of each algorithm on lists of elements.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Easy-to-use interface allowing users to input a list of elements for sorting.

## How to Use

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure Python is installed.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the `Sorting_Algorithms.py` file.
   - The graphical interface window will open.

3. **Algorithm Comparison:**
   - Enter a list of elements separated by commas in the dedicated area.
   - Click "Sort" to compare the execution times of different algorithms on the given list.

## Element Lists
Elements to be sorted should be entered in the text area using comma-separated values (e.g., 5,12,1,10,6).

### Note
- Ensure to input integer values separated by commas for comparing sorting algorithms.

## Contributing
Contributions to add new sorting algorithms or enhance existing ones are welcome! Check the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines.
